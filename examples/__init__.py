"""
The *examples* module is devoted to the testing of the methods implemented in *src* on some test cases,
as the name suggests; because of this, it is divided in several submodules, each one referring to a specific toy
problem. Since in the context of this project we have just focused on the thermal block problem (both steady and
unsteady), we will just consider the two related submodules, i.e. *thermal_block_unsteady* and *thermal_block_unsteady*.
