"""
The *examples* module is devoted to the testing of the methods implemented in *src* on some test cases,
as the name suggests; because of this, it is divided in several submodules, each one referring to a specific toy
problem. Specifically, we considered: *Stokes*, *Navier-Stokes* and *Membrane* (coupled momentum) test cases.
